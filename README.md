# Minor-Project
Community-Oriented Evaluation Framework of Mobile Learning Apps
# Project Overview
This research project focuses on developing a Community-Oriented Evaluation Framework for Mobile Learning Applications. 
The aim is to analyze and compare different mobile learning apps based on community engagement, usability, accessibility, content quality, and learning effectiveness.
# Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of mobile learning platforms, there is a lack of standard evaluation frameworks that focus on community participation and collaborative learning.
Most existing evaluation models focus only on:
> Technical performance
> Content quality
> User interface
However, community interaction, learner engagement, peer support, and feedback mechanisms are often ignored.
This project aims to design and apply a framework that evaluates mobile learning apps from a community-oriented perspective, helping educators, developers, and learners to better understand app effectiveness.
